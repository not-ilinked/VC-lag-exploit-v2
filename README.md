# Heads up!
This exploit is already patched. I'm sorry i couldn't release it in time...

# What's new?
This exploit is actually a lot like the [old one](https://github.com/not-ilinked/VC-lag-exploit) in the sense that it still lags out other clients by sending massive amounts of [SSRC updates](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3550#section-5.1).
The old one was patched because Discord added ratelimits to media WebSockets, however, as it turns out, this can easily be bypassed by just creating more WebSocket connections (session ID's and stuff are reusable, and for some reason everything gets reset).
This alone works fine on smaller servers, but for bigger ones connecting to the WebSocket can take up to 700 ms, which is way too much. 
For that reason i made some modifications to Anarchy to let me create connections without authenticating right away (that would disconnect the old WebSocket).

TL;DR the exploit continuously creates media WebSocket connections, authenticating and sending just the max amount of SSRC updates for each.

## How do i install it?
Clone the repo, open the .sln file in Visual Studio (make sure you have .NET Framework 4.7 installed) and add a reference to Anarchy (clone that too).
After building add the required [voice binaries](https://anarchyteam.dev/voice_binaries.zip) to bin/Debug or bin/Release, set your alt's token in Token.txt and run it!
